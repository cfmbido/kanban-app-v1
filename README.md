Kanban Board App Flow:

- Fetch Groups API
- Fetch Tasks By Groups Id using Promise.All
- Render Data

##

I choose this method because the API didn't provide join tasks when fetching groups

##

Features Done :

- Fetch Groups and Tasks
- Create Task
- Edit Task
- Delete Task
- Move Task
- Drag and Drop
